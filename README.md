**Get started with the Strapi headless CMS by building a complete learning management system API**

## What is this book about?
Strapi is a Node.js-based, flexible, open-source headless CMS with an integrated admin panel that anyone can use and helps save API development time. APIs built with Strapi can be consumed using REST or GraphQL from any client. With this book, you'll take a hands-on approach to exploring the capabilities of the Strapi platform and creating a custom API from scratch.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore Strapi and understand how it works
* Define content types to build APIs quickly and efficiently

```
{
 "data": {
  "title": "Content types in Strapi",
  "slug": "content-types-in-strapi",
  "type": "text",
  "contents": "Content types in Strapi allows us to
  define the entities that make up the api",
  "classroom": 1
 }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for backend and frontend JavaScript developers. Experienced API developers will learn a new, fast, and flexible way of building APIs, while frontend developers will be able to take a step toward becoming full-stack developers by learning how to leverage Strapi for building APIs quickly. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and REST API concepts is assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
